## Problem Statement

Recruitment Assisting platform which will help recruiters filter out resumes for a particular job profile.
By Team CodeCrafters

## Need of the Project

Motto- By evaluating all candidates against the same screening standards, … the process will be more objective, fair and accurate.

* Evaluator should set list of standards and criteria to compare resumes
* Job Description/ any other relevant information should also be compared with resume
* Standards should not be bend, as they were created to meet the job expectations
* There are hundreds of millions of candidate profiles and CVs online
* Manual screening of resumes is still the most time-consuming part of recruiting 
* 75% to 88% of the resumes received for a role are unqualified
* Screening resumes and shortlisting candidates to interview is estimated to take 23 hours of a recruiter’s time for a single hire.

## How ML Helps Us?

Machines are better at certain things such as:
1. Sourcing 
2. Screening
3. Matching
4. Assessing
5. Helps to eliminate human bias, like candidate’s age, race, and gender by assessing candidates purely on their merits.
6. Low-value, time consuming recruiting tasks will become streamlined and automated.
7. Recruiter’s role will become more strategic.

## Tasks

* Apply ML to segregate the resumes into different classes or groups. These classes or groups must be utilised to enhance the Resume based Search Engine. 
* Create a recommender system which will prompt the recruiter with skills related to the filters provided to enhance the search. 
* Create an automated Scraper to fetch profiles from public recruitment based platforms.
* Association based mining to be used. The recruiter just needs to provide the post or position in the organisation and the tool should provide the recommended candidates
